# gradecalc
This program is a simple test of my Javascript and flask knowledge to create a weighted grade calculator. Simply enter your assignments, grades, and respective weights,
then click calculate to see your final grade. More features will be added later.

## Usage
1. Activate venv with ```source venv/Scripts/activate```
2. Download requirements from **requirements.txt** with ```pip install -r requirements.text```
3. Run with ```flask --debug run``` for auto-refresh or ```flask run``` without debug mode.
