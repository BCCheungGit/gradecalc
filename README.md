# gradecalc
This program is a simple test of my Javascript and flask knowledge to create a weighted grade calculator. Simply enter your assignments, grades, and respective weights,
then click calculate to see your final grade. More features will be added later.

## Usage
1. Create Python virtual environment

```shell
python -m venv venv
```

2. Start virtual environment

```shell
source venv/Scripts/activate
```

3. Install requirements

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the program

```shell
flask --debug run
```

or

```shell
flask run
```

## ToDo

- [x] add new rows functionality
- [x] add results page
- [ ] add required grade to get a certain average feature
